Project Title: Movie Recommendation System with Supervised Learning

Introduction:
The project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using a combination of content-based filtering and supervised learning techniques. The system suggests movies to users based on similarities between movie features and predicts certain attributes of movies using supervised learning models.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The project utilizes the TMDB movie dataset, which contains information about movies such as titles, genres, keywords, cast, crew, and ratings. The data is preprocessed by converting stringified lists to Python lists, combining relevant features into a single 'tags' column, and vectorizing the text data using CountVectorizer.

Content-Based Filtering:
Content-based filtering is employed to recommend movies to users based on similarities between movie features. The cosine similarity metric is used to calculate the similarity between movies, and recommendations are made based on the most similar movies to a given movie.

Supervised Learning Model:
In addition to content-based filtering, a supervised learning model is incorporated to predict certain attributes of movies. The RandomForestRegressor model is trained to predict movie attributes such as vote_average, revenue, or title based on the movie features.

Evaluation:
The performance of the supervised learning model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error for regression tasks or accuracy metrics for text classification tasks. Additionally, the effectiveness of the recommendation system can be assessed through user studies or online evaluations.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the implementation of a movie recommendation system that combines content-based filtering with supervised learning techniques. By leveraging movie features and user preferences, the system can provide personalized movie recommendations and predict various attributes of movies with reasonable accuracy.
